              Mercedes owners in the U.S. will soon add a new luxury to their
              already luxurious vehicles: ChatGPT. The automaker is adding
              OpenAIâ€™s conversational AI agent to its MBUX infotainment system,
              though what it could possibly be needed for is hard to say.
